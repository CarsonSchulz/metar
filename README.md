# METAR Translator

> A personal project made by <a href="https://carsons.me/">Carson</a>

Due to a lack of projects being up on my portfolio site, I made a simple web tool that utilizes a variety of different languages. These include Javascript, PHP, CSS, SCSS, and JSON. There is also an API that feeds airport data to the tool (Credit: https://github.com/kdknigga/aeroinfo/blob/master/API.md).

The demo of the tool is <a href="https://carsons.me/metar">here</a>.
